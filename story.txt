There once was a garbanzo bean named Steve the Second. After Ariel created her story about Steve the First, git decided to not cooperate and get mad at her. She decided to write about Steve the Second instead! Steve the Bean was a nice garbanzo bean that just wanted to be great, but could not be. This was for verious reasons. First of all, he could not write code in java. All he knew was COBOL, because that was important 15 years earlier when Steve The First was in school and Steve the First had taught Steve the Second. The second reason Steve the second was not great was because he was a smol bean. The third and final reason was that Steve the Second did not know how to implement a red0black tree. One day, Steve decided he wanted to change this. He wanted to be the second Steve the Garbanzo Bean the Great. This is the story of how he changed and became great.
